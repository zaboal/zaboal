**Notice about me and the texts for non-Russian speakers:**

> My name is Bogdan Alekseevich Zazhigin, I am from `Russia/Saint-Petersburg`. I do not write in English because I target russian auditory, also I don't think that I know it enough to have right publically write in it, better to talk with native speakers now. You can chat with me on English here: [`za.boal@vk.com`](mailto://za.boal@vk.com), [`zaboal@telegram`](https://t.me/zaboal).

> **Translation of the "Bio":**
> > Born on the winter 2007 in Murmansk, later moved to Saint-Petersburg. I went on administrative managament, [copywriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) and programming. I use Linux after I turned 11.
