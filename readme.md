# my principles

**minuscule**: uppercase from the origin it was an emphasis tool and doesn't 
play any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. an emblem 
for it is ðŸ”¡, as an opposite for ðŸ” .

**disabbreviation**: to make consistent file structure, where are 
"`internal`" and "`pkg`" or "`cmd`" in same place, i disabbreviate 
them to "`packages`" and "`commands`". novadays there is no need
in short names with auto-completion and in-shell abbreviations.
