# stack

- **i code in [`go`](https://w.wiki/9VuF)**. when i was 10 i'd been programming in
[`c++`](https://w.wiki/35Gx) and got used to static typing, so i didn't like
[`python`](https://w.wiki/PoF) and [`typescript`](https://w.wiki/5WMt) with their cosmetic
types. have tried [`haskell`](https://w.wiki/8yNr), [`ruby`](https://w.wiki/9VuP),
[`raku`](https://w.wiki/9VuT), and other forgettable.

- **i code for [`linux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)**. in the same ages,
my want to hack a wi-fi coincided with father's new business: programming for children 
on thinkpads with lubuntu. i'd take one and experimented with [`debian`](https://w.wiki/9VuS), 
[`opensuse`](https://w.wiki/5kfD), [`arch`](https://w.wiki/9VuV), [`fedora`](https://w.wiki/7caP), 
and other forgettable.

- **i code with [`vscode`](https://w.wiki/3oas)** as it universal and requires less time to setup for 
small projects in opposite to [`vim`](https://w.wiki/PoB). [`emacs`](https://w.wiki/9VuY) goes against unix.


# personal projects principles

- **minuscule**: uppercase from the origin it was an emphasis tool and doesn't 
play any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. an emblem 
for it is ðŸ”¡, as an opposite for ðŸ” .

- **disabbreviation**: to make consistent file structure, where are 
"`internal`" and "`pkg`" or "`cmd`" in same place, i disabbreviate 
them to "`packages`" and "`commands`". novadays there is no need
in short names with auto-completion and in-shell abbreviations.
