| i code… (stack) | personal projects principles

| **in {wiki}9VuF[{golang}]**. when i was 10 i'd been programming in
{wiki}35Gx[`c++`] and got used to static typing, so i didn't like
{wiki}PoF[`python`] and {wiki}5WMt[`typescript`] with their
cosmetic types. have tried {wiki}8yNr[`haskell`],
{wiki}9VuP[`ruby`], {wiki}9VuT[`raku`], and other forgettable.

**for {wiki}9VuS[{debian}]**. in the same ages, my want to hack a wi-fi
coincided with father's new business: programming for teens on thinkpads with
{wiki}9VvY[`lubuntu`]. had taken one and tried
{wiki}9VuS[`debian`], {wiki}5kfD[`opensuse`],
{wiki}9VuV[`arch`], {wiki}7caP[`fedora`], and other.

**with {wiki}3oas[{vscode}]** as it more universal and easier than
{wiki}PoB[`vim`].

| **minuscule**: uppercase from the origin was an emphasis tool and doesn't play
any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. so i dont press shift when
write comments and logs. an emblem for it is 🔡, as an opposite for 🔠.

**disabbreviation**: to make consistent file structure, where are "`internal`"
and "`pkg`" or "`cmd`" in same place, i disabbreviate them to "`packages`" and
"`commands`". nowadays there is no need for short names with auto-completion and
in-shell abbreviations.
