| i codeâ€¦ (stack) | personal projects principles

| **in https://w.wiki/9VuF[`go`]**. when i was 10 i'd been programming in
https://w.wiki/35Gx[`c++`] and got used to static typing, so i didn't like
https://w.wiki/PoF[`python`] and https://w.wiki/5WMt[`typescript`] with their cosmetic
types. have tried https://w.wiki/8yNr[`haskell`], https://w.wiki/9VuP[`ruby`],
https://w.wiki/9VuT[`raku`], and other forgettable.

**for https://w.wiki/S5C[`linux`]**. in the same ages,
my want to hack a wi-fi coincided with father's new business: programming for children 
on thinkpads with lubuntu. had take one and tried https://w.wiki/9VuS[`debian`], 
https://w.wiki/5kfD[`opensuse`], https://w.wiki/9VuV[`arch`], https://w.wiki/7caP[`fedora`], 
and other forgettable.

**with https://w.wiki/3oas[`vscode`]** as it more universal and easier than https://w.wiki/PoB[`vim`].

| **minuscule**: uppercase from the origin was an emphasis tool and doesn't 
play any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. so i dont
press shift when write comments and logs. an emblem for it is ğŸ”¡, as 
an opposite for ğŸ” .

**disabbreviation**: to make consistent file structure, where are 
"`internal`" and "`pkg`" or "`cmd`" in same place, i disabbreviate 
them to "`packages`" and "`commands`". novadays there is no need
in short names with auto-completion and in-shell abbreviations.
