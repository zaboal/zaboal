*in {wiki}9VuF[`go`]*. when i was 10 i'd been programming in {wiki}35Gx[`c++`]
and got used to static typing, so i didn't like {wiki}PoF[`python`] and
{wiki}5WMt[`typescript`] with their cosmetic types. have tried
{wiki}8yNr[`haskell`], {wiki}9VuP[`ruby`], {wiki}9VuT[`raku`], and other
forgettable.

*for {wiki}S5C[`linux`]*. in the same ages, my want to hack a wi-fi coincided
with father's new business: programming for teens on thinkpads with
{wiki}9VvY[`lubuntu`]. had taken one and tried {wiki}9VuS[`debian`],
{wiki}5kfD[`opensuse`], {wiki}9VuV[`arch`], {wiki}7caP[`fedora`], and other.

*with {wiki}3oas[`vscode`]* as it more universal and easier than
{wiki}PoB[`vim`].

*lowercase logs and comments*: uppercase from the origin was an emphasis tool
and doesn't play any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. so i dont
press shift when write comments and logs. an emblem for it is üî°, as an opposite
for üî†.

*directories disabbreviation* to make consistent file structure, where are
`./internal` and `./pkg` or `./cmd` in same place, i disabbreviate them to
`./packages` and `./commands`. nowadays there is no need for short names with
auto-completion and in-shell abbreviations.
