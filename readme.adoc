**i code in https://w.wiki/9VuF[`go`]**. when i was 10 i'd been programming in
https://w.wiki/35Gx[`c++`] and got used to static typing, so i didn't like
https://w.wiki/PoF[`python`] and https://w.wiki/5WMt[`typescript`] with their cosmetic
types. have tried https://w.wiki/8yNr[`haskell`], https://w.wiki/9VuP[`ruby`],
https://w.wiki/9VuT[`raku`], and other forgettable.

**i code for https://w.wiki/S5C[`linux`]**. in the same ages,
my want to hack a wi-fi coincided with father's new business: programming for children 
on thinkpads with lubuntu. i'd take one and experimented with https://w.wiki/9VuS[`debian`], 
https://w.wiki/5kfD[`opensuse`], https://w.wiki/9VuV[`arch`], https://w.wiki/7caP[`fedora`], 
and other forgettable.

**i code with https://w.wiki/3oas[`vscode`]** as it universal and easier to setup for 
small projects in opposite to https://w.wiki/PoB[`vim`]. https://w.wiki/9VuY[`emacs`] goes against unix.


= personal projects principles

**minuscule**:: uppercase from the origin was an emphasis tool and doesn't 
play any role in grammar. dot stands for sentence ending. an emblem 
for it is ðŸ”¡, as an opposite for ðŸ” .

**disabbreviation**:: to make consistent file structure, where are 
"`internal`" and "`pkg`" or "`cmd`" in same place, i disabbreviate 
them to "`packages`" and "`commands`". novadays there is no need
in short names with auto-completion and in-shell abbreviations.
