# decompose resume onto content-specific platforms

duplication of information about you across sites or to a pdf is pointless


so, at the moment, i parted it onto four cross-linked platforms; 
links to which are shortened with an own domain `zba.su`
to be able to switch a platform and keep its functional link:
 
| platform   | content and its shortened link                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| linkedin   | the aside info, [`resume`](https://zba.su/resume) |
| github     | coding [`portfolio`](https://zba.su/portfolio)    |
| keyoxide   | [`contact`](https://zba.su/contact) info          |
| and fiverr | [`services`](https://zba.su/services)             |

i might use keybase instead of keyoxide
if it would have skype verification or linkedin,
but it doesn't have it and much more that keyoxide has.
