# ZaBoAl's Meaning of Life

**Man** is a system with the same as any other consciousness,
that dies accidentally.
His meaning of life is only a soothing in the face of death, 
the scare of which is primal.

> We are men.

**Consciousness** is just a utility that just had to appear for evolutional purposes, 
despiting its magical nature, that connects knowledge and ego.
Our, artificial, and animal awarenesses are equal.
So, for example, antinatalism is appearing baseless.

In the optimistic variant of **the meaning**, we are on to occupy the cosmos, find
a new meaning,
increase our survivability, et cetera; and in the hopeless pessimistic variant, where we
think that humanity will die anyway, we're on to just enjoy this life. Laying to
the first, it's better to dissolve the submissions of the mission we figured out
into habits, principles, and other things, that form our mindset that effects actions
in the moment.

So, in the face of death, I think that I've been living right the way my
consciousness has chosen, rather than that I had to accomplish something.
